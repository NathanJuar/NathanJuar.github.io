### CPSC 120

Lab 07, part 1 

- I had enjoyed this lab as I learned the ability and ways different codes and functions interact in a more logical and mathematical sense. It created such a different output as the math and the logistics don’t feel like it’ll compile but work and interact with each other. With that I enjoyed the code it created and the ability to find the distance between two dates and compile the math to display an answer. Also with how it interacts with a real world date and gives the user an input in which it would seem useful.

Lab 09, part 1

- It is the math and combination that makes this lab one of my favorites. The part of getting an average and getting scores to be imputed and use the program is something that I enjoyed. Also with the learning that a user input is easy to compile and subtract unwanted to unneeded number or item that was inputted. It taught me also how to find greatest and least sums within an array of numbers.

Lab 11, part 2

- The lab has input from the user and output by the computer depending on which number was chosen. It was our first game and created a guessing game where the user can use numbers to figure and guess what the computer generated number is. It combined both concepts of the difference between numbers and user input to give a response. This makes me enjoy and really like tha lab as it also teaches me about the random variable.
